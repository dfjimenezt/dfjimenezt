The Microsoft team has released an 18-lesson course, [Generative AI for Beginners Version 2](https://github.com/microsoft/generative-ai-for-beginners) 2, as part of their Generative AI Learning Collection. 

I decided to go through these lessons and share my notes.

*Examples are taken from the course.*


# Course Setup
This course uses Azure AI Studio. Before proceeding, ensure you have access to it. You can either use a pay-as-you-go subscription, request a trial, or apply to be accepted into the Microsoft for Startups program.

**Azure AI Studio**
Is a Cloud Platform designed for developers to build generative AI applications and manage the whole development lifecycle - from experimentation to evaluation - by combining all Azure AI services into a single hub with an handy GUI.

# Introduction to AI
It's important to note that artificial intelligence (AI) is a broader concept that has been around since the 1956. Currently, we are exploring Generative AI, which is the result of years of research and breakthroughs. Modern AI approaches are non-deterministic, working by translating text into a series of tokens and then predicting the next possible token in a sequence using statistics and a randomness factor known as temperature.

## Tokenization
Tokenization involves translating a series of words into numeric form, making it easier for the model to learn and work since it is a statistical model.

## Assignment
What can be created or improved with AI?

# Exploring and Comparing Different Type of LLMs

## Foundation Models
Foundation models are self-trained models that serve as a base for fine-tuning the models we use.

> A foundation model is any model that is trained on broad data (generally using self-supervision at scale) that can be adapted (e.g., fine-tuned) to a wide range of downstream tasks; current examples include BERT [Devlin et al. 2019], GPT-3 [Brown et al. 2020], and CLIP [Radford et al. 2021]. From a technological point of view, foundation models are not new â€” they are based on deep neural networks and self-supervised learning, both of which have existed for decades. However, the sheer scale and scope of foundation models from the last few years have stretched our imagination of what is possible; for example, GPT-3 has 175 billion parameters and can be adapted via natural language prompts to do a passable job on a wide range of tasks despite not being trained explicitly to do many of those tasks [Brown et al. 2020]. At the same time, existing foundation models have the potential to accentuate harms, and their characteristics are in general poorly understood. Given their impending widespread deployment, they have become a topic of intense scrutiny [Bender et al. 2021].

## Model Classification
Models can be classified by their ***license, Output, Architecture,*** and ***Commercial Offering:***
### License
#### OpenSource Models
* Alpaca
* Bloom
* LLaMA.

#### Propietary Models
* OpenAI models
* Google Gemini
* Claude 2.

### Ouput
#### Embeddings
They transform the text into numerical form 
* [OpenAI embeddings models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/embeddings)

#### Image Generation
Image generation models
* DALL-E
* Stable Diffusion

#### Text or Code Generation
* BookCorpus
* CodeParrot

### Architecture
Models can be classified as Encoder, Decoder or Both.

#### Encoder
These models are good at understanding the input and finding a relation with the context.
* BERT

#### Decoder
These models are good at generating ouputs based on the context.
* GPT

#### Encoder / Decoder
Think on having a *Encoder Model* feeding the *Decoder model*.

> If you are somehow familiar with Control Theory thinking on Open / Close Loops with the models.
* BART
* T5

### Commercial Offering

#### Service
Often offered by a *Cloud Service Provider* their offering includes a set of of models, data, and other components.
* Azure Open AI

#### Models
Isolated models either as an OpenSource you can use, allowing companies to run locally, however, may require equipment, build structure to scale and model specific licensing
* LLama  

## Deploying and Improving LLM results
***Azure AI Studio*** includes a enriched catalog of models we can use to create our platform, with such variety selecting the best model is a mix of deploy, experiment, measure, making Azure AI Studio a great tool to fast deploy an iterate.
