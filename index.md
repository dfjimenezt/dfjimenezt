>*Whether you think you can or you think you can’t, you’re right - Henry Ford*

During the last decade I have had the pleasure to witness how the technology has been transforming the life of millions of people. The good news is that it will continue to happen, we now have the technology to solve complex problems it all start by `imagine` how can we make better.

# The Convergence Point; my point of view on DeepTech and Entrepreneurship

DeepTech is a curious and evolving term, it refers to the latest trends in technology it is crafted at the heart of investigation centers and Universities, which reminds me when I was in my Univerity days studying Mechatronics at the National Univeristy in Colombia which actually nobody knew what it was and maybe I wasn´t sure what it was in my first days. We are now 14 years from that moment and Robotics is becoming a trend, there is no car sold without an infotainment, even Autonomous vehicles are a thing you can get.

> Innovation often looks like the tiny stand in the corner of a tradeshow

If we were in XV century we would call DeepTech to what Davinci was working on, as per 2024 DeepTech is categorized into 10 topics.

* Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML),
* Biotechnology and Life Sciences,
* Advanced Materials,
* Quantum Computing,
* Robotics and Automation,
* Internet of Things (IoT),
* Space Technology,
* Energy and Environmental Technology,
* Blockchain and Distributed Ledger Technology,
* Neuroscience and Neurotechnology.

To my point of view any tech won't do the job itself, I have seen, worked, and deployed multiple projects that are going straight to the shelve even when they are amazing, they create a new technology or open opportunities to people.

In the other hand I have seen amazing people solving a problem with what I call ***duct-tape technology*** this is mind blowing, they are often called Entrepreneurs as you may guess.

Putting all together the convergence point I want to talk about is not merging all of these technologies together, it is about how using Entrepreneurship mindset, methodologies and DeepTech to solve problems.
